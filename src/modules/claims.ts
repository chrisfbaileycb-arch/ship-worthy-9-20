/**
 * Claims module — can the promises in your listing be substantiated?
 *
 * The one module whose findings originate from a model rather than a regex, and
 * therefore the one where the evidence rule has to be enforced hardest.
 *
 * The gate: every quote the model returns is looked up in the source text the
 * user actually submitted. A quote that cannot be located is discarded and
 * counted. The excerpt stored on the finding is the SOURCE's wording, not the
 * model's — so what the user reads back is their own sentence, character for
 * character, even if the model tidied it on the way through.
 *
 * This is what makes `makeFinding()` honest for model output. Without it,
 * `evidence.excerpt` would be whatever the model typed, and a fabricated quote
 * would sail through the same constructor that a real one does — which is
 * precisely how BrandGuard came to print USPTO serial numbers for a registry it
 * never called.
 *
 * Two cost tiers:
 *   - Deterministic pre-checks run locally, free, signed-out, and catch the
 *     absolute language that is wrong regardless of what the app does.
 *   - The model pass runs server-side behind auth and a rate limit, and finds
 *     the claims a pattern cannot: implied comparisons, unstated conditions,
 *     promises assembled across a sentence.
